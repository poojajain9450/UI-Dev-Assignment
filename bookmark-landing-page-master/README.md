# Bookmark landing page

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

**The challenge here is to do design this without using any CSS frameworks like Bootstrap**


Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Receive an error message when the newsletter form (Stay up-to-date with what weâ€™re doing section) is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

For this challenge you'll need to:

- Create the rounded blue background shape with code
- Change the `fill` and `stroke` color of the SVGs at specific points (the challenge can be completed using the single `logo-bookmark.svg` file provided)

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:


1. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
2. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
3. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
4. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Submitting your solution

Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with us. Once you complete your code in github repository then share its public url over email.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
